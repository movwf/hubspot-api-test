**Debrief**

- **Code Quality & Readability**
  - Modularize the codebase by moving API clients, database logic, and utility functions into separate folders.
  - Separate process functions into their own modules, even if they share context, to improve clarity.
  - Refactor repetitive process functions by introducing abstract processors and transformers for better maintainability.
  - Use TypeScript or add JSDoc comments to clarify function purposes and expected types.

- **Project Architecture**
  - Refactor the monolithic structure into distinct modules:
    - HubSpot API interactions
    - Queue and batch processing
    - Action creation
    - Persistence (database save)
    - Utilities (e.g., retry logic)
  - Improve queue management by using dedicated message brokers like RabbitMQ or BullMQ.
  - Implement dead-letter queues (DLQs) and robust failure handling for better reliability.
  - Consider splitting data persistence into a separate follow-up cron job to distribute load.

- **Code Performance**
  - Optimize retry logic to avoid excessive latency from exponential backoff.
  - Adjust queue concurrency to match system capabilities and prevent overload.
  - Ensure atomic batch operations to prevent race conditions and data loss during queue-to-database processing.
  - Enhance error logging and handle failures gracefully for easier debugging and recovery.

- **Bugs & Issues Encountered**
  - Incorrect filter operators in `generateLastModifiedDateFilter` (e.g., GTQ vs. GTE).
  - Insufficient error logs for HubSpot API calls.
  - Pagination offset resets every 100th page due to a logic bug.
  - Unnecessary deep cloning in the queue could cause memory leaks.
  - Failures in processing steps require manual re-runs.
